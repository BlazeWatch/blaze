# :fire: Blaze: Igniting the Future of Fire Detection :fire:

Blaze is a state-of-the-art fire detection and analysis machine learning model. Using the heat of sentiment analysis, it's more than just a flash in the pan â€“ it's a roaring blaze that revolutionizes the way we understand and respond to fire.

## Accuracy Metrics
Blaze brings unprecedented accuracy in its predictions:
- **Temperature Analysis**: Achieving an impressive `98.90%` accuracy with LSTM, Blaze is an expert in temperature-based fire predictions. :thermometer:
- **NLP Analysis**: With a scorching `99.77%` accuracy using BERT for text classification, Blaze has mastered the art of fire-related content detection in social media. :bird:

## Features

- **Blazingly Fast**: With a fiery algorithm that's hotter than a chili pepper, Blaze cuts through the noise and delivers results in a flash.:rocket:
- **BERT for Text Classification**: By leveraging the BERT model, Blaze sparks insight into message information from social media, like Twitter, to detect and classify fire-related content. :bird:
- **LSTM for Temperature Analysis**: With an LSTM that's as hot as a summer's day, Blaze can predict when a fire is occurring or about to occur through temperature analysis. :thermometer:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlazeWatch/blaze.git
   ```

2. Install the requirements
   ```bash
   cd blaze
